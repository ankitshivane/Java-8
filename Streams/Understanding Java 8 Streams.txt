overview of java 8 streams
why Streams?
Nowadays, because of the tremendous amount of development on the hardware front, multicore CPUs are becoming more and more general. In order to leverage the hardware capabilities Java had introduced Fork Join Framework. Java 8 Streams API supports many parallel operations to process the data, while completely abstracting out the low level multithreading logic and letting the developer fully concentrate on the data and the operations to be performed on the data.

what is parallel processing in stream?
Most of us know, parallel processing is all about dividing a larger task into smaller sub tasks (forking), then processing the sub tasks in parallel and then combining the results together to get the final output (joining). Java 8 Streams API provides a similar mechanism to work with Java Collections. The Java 8 Streams concept is based on converting Collections to a Stream, processing the elements in parallel and then gathering the resulting elements into a Collection.
